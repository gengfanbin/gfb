如果你不想使用庞大的脚手架，又想体验数据驱动的便利性时，这个库是你不二的选择。

When you don't want to use a huge scaffold and want to experience the convenience of data drive, this library is your only choice.

它的大小只有几个K，实现了最原始的数据驱动功能。

It is only a few K in size, realizing the most primitive data-driven function.

它只有几个主要且易于理解的API，因此开发人员可以自由地利用他们的想象力开发自己的页面。

It has only a few main and easy to understand APIs, so that developers can freely use their imagination to develop their own pages.

它的语法类似于react，但没有虚拟dom。开发人员可以以原生方式操作DOM节点。

Its syntax is similar to react, but it has no virtual dom. Developers can manipulate DOM nodes in a native way.

由于它是以原生DOM操作实现，所以只要您熟悉它，就可以轻松地将其嵌入任何已知的前端UI框架中。

Because it is a native DOM operation, it can be easily embedded in any known front-end UI framework, provided that you are familiar with that framework.

例如，您可以使用它开发自己的UI组件，然后将它们同时嵌入react、Vue、angular和其他框架中。

For example, you can use it to develop your own UI components, and then embed them into react, Vue, angular and other frameworks at the same time.

目前，它还比较年轻，需要成长。希望得到更多的帮助。

At present, it is still young and needs to grow. Hope to get more help.
