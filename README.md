When you don't want to use a huge scaffold and want to experience the convenience of data drive, this library is your only choice.

It is only a few K in size, realizing the most primitive data-driven function.

It has only a few main and easy to understand APIs, so that developers can freely use their imagination to develop their own pages.

Its syntax is similar to react, but it has no virtual dom. Developers can manipulate DOM nodes in a native way.

Because it is a native DOM operation, it can be easily embedded in any known front-end UI framework, provided that you are familiar with that framework.

For example, you can use it to develop your own UI components, and then embed them into react, Vue, angular and other frameworks at the same time.

At present, it is still relatively young and needs to grow up. It hopes to accept people's teaching.
